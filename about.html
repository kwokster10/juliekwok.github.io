  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about-body">
    Hi! I'm Julie Kwok, a full stack web developer residing in NYC. My enthusiasm to learn drives my commitment for
    self-growth personally and professionally. My journey into coding started in 2015 when I enrolled in the
    Web Development Immersive course at <a href="{{site.data.education.url}}" target="_blank">
    {{site.data.education.name}}</a> (GA) in NYC. The curriculum at the time focused heavily on Javascript
    and Ruby paired with technologies like Node.js, Backbone.js, Rails, SQLite, and Postgres.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Post-GA, I apprenticed at <a href="{{site.data.work_experience[0].url}}" target="_blank">
    {{site.data.work_experience[0].name}}</a> where I was paired with senior developer consultants to develop
    my programming skills. Under their tutelage, I gained valuable experience implementing agile test-driven
    development, object-oriented programming, and debugging code. The culture at Cyrus was community driven by
    encouraging community involvement through meet-ups, blog posts, and open-source contributions.
    The apprenticeship program was created to give back to the development community by nurturing the knowledge
    of fresh boot camp graduates with best industry practices and placing them at clients with the same mindset.
    That is how I landed my current engineering position at
    <a href="{{site.data.work_experience[1].url}}" target="_blank">{{site.data.work_experience[1].name}}</a>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At XO, my team and I improve the workflow of vendors in our wedding marketplace. Through XO Group's brand,
    The Knot.com, we <i>provide couples with a completely personalized experience that guides them through the entire
    wedding planning journey</i>. On a daily basis, I work with Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Grunt, and Webpack on the
    back-end, and Javascript, jQuery, React.js, and Angular I on the front-end.
    <br/>
