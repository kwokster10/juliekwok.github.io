  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <div class="about-body">
    Hi, my name is Julie Kwok. I'm a web developer with a bountiful enthusiasm to learn.
    My journey into coding began with the Web Development Immersive course at
    <a href="{{site.data.education.url}}" target="_blank">{{site.data.education.name}}</a> (GA)
    in NYC in March 2015. The curriculum at the time focused heavily on Javascript and Ruby paired
    with technologies like Node.js, Backbone.js, Rails, SQLite, and Postgres.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    After GA, I entered into an apprenticeship with
    <a href="{{site.data.work_experience[0].url}}" target="_blank">{{site.data.work_experience[0].name}}</a>,
    where I pair programmed with senior developer consultants. Under their tutelage, I gained valuable experience
    implementing agile test-driven development, object-oriented programming, and debugging code. Cyrus was
    also great at encouraging community involvement through meetups, blog posts, and open-source contributions.
    The apprenticeship program was their way of giving back to the development community by nurturing the
    knowledge of fresh boot camp graduates with best industry practices and placing them at clients
    with the same mindset. That is how I got my position at
    <a href="{{site.data.work_experience[1].url}}" target="_blank">{{site.data.work_experience[1].name}}</a>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    At XO, I work on the team that improves the workflow of vendors in our marketplace, who are ready to
    help couples prepare for the day they say 'I do'. My day to day involves working with Ruby on Rails,
    Node.js, Grunt, and Webpack on the backend, and Javascript, jQuery, React.js, and Angular I on the front-end.

    If you would like to learn more or you need help with your site, I would love to hear from you.
    Reach me through one of the outlets below.
